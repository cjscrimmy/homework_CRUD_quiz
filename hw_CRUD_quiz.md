# CRUD Quiz

Use the solution to this afternoon's Property Tracker lab to answer the following questions. Please write your answers under each question, push the file to GitHub, and submit in the usual way.

## MVP Questions

In our Property Tracker application:

Q1. Where are we instantiating instances of the `Property` class?
A1. In the console.rb file

Q2. Where are we defining the SQL that enables us to save the ruby `Property` object into the database?
A2. In the property.rb file

Q3. In `console.rb`, which lines modify the database?
A3. lines 13, 22, 31, 33

Q4. Why do we not define the id of a `Property` object at the point we instantiate it (‘new it up’)?
A4. The id for each object of Property is created by the database when they are inserted into the database.  

Q5. Where and how do we assign the id (that is generated by the database) to the ruby `Property` object?
A5. The id is assigned in the property.rb file. It is to assigned to 
the object by setting the @id variable of the instance to equal the id that has been returned by the database.

Q6. Why do we put a guard (an `if` clause) on the `@id` attribute in the constructor?
A6. This is added so that @id is only set if one exists for that instance.

Q7. Why are some of the CRUD actions represented by instance methods, and others by class methods?
A7.

Q8. What type of data structure is returned by calls to `db.exec_prepared()`? In the `save` method, how do we access the id from the returned data structure?

Q9. Why do we use prepared statements when performing database operations?

## Extension Questions

Look at the `find_by_id` and `find_by_address` methods in the `Property` class.

Q10. What do they take in as their arguments?

Q11. What are their return values?
