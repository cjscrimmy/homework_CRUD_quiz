# CRUD Quiz

Use the solution to this afternoon's Property Tracker lab to answer the following questions. Please write your answers under each question, push the file to GitHub, and submit in the usual way.

## MVP Questions

In our Property Tracker application:

Q1. Where are we instantiating instances of the `Property` class?
A1. In the console.rb file

Q2. Where are we defining the SQL that enables us to save the ruby `Property` object into the database?
A2. In the property.rb file

Q3. In `console.rb`, which lines modify the database?
A3. lines 13, 22, 31, 33

Q4. Why do we not define the id of a `Property` object at the point we instantiate it (‘new it up’)?
A4. The id for each object of Property is created by the database when they are inserted into the database.  

Q5. Where and how do we assign the id (that is generated by the database) to the ruby `Property` object?
A5. The id is assigned in the property.rb file. It is to assigned to 
the object by setting the @id variable of the instance to equal the id that has been returned by the database.

Q6. Why do we put a guard (an `if` clause) on the `@id` attribute in the constructor?
A6. This is added so that @id is only set if one exists for that instance.

Q7. Why are some of the CRUD actions represented by instance methods, and others by class methods?
A7. The save and update methods are used to insert or update a single row in
the database. Each row is equal to one instance and the instance itself 
should be responsible for saving and updating itself. This is the same for 
delete. The class should be involved with searching and reading the data.
The instances shouldn't be in involved with search for data because 
searching is a higher level function and is used to search the database
at large.

Q8. What type of data structure is returned by calls to `db.exec_prepared()`? In the `save` method, how do we access the id from the returned data structure?
A8. db.exec_prepared() returns a pg object which is an array of hashes.
The id is accessed by looking into the start of the pg array and 
accessing the id field of the hash and turning it into an int.
Once this is done, you set the returned id to @id instance variable.  

Q9. Why do we use prepared statements when performing database operations?

## Extension Questions

Look at the `find_by_id` and `find_by_address` methods in the `Property` class.

Q10. What do they take in as their arguments?

Q11. What are their return values?
